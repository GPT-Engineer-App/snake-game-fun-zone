# snake-game-fun-zone

A snake game for the browser, which can be controlled by the arrow keys. The snake is growing if it eats something. If the snake bits itself you are game over. If the snake hits the border -> Game over. For each eaten piece the level is counting up and the background color of the playing field is switching randomly. The piece to eat are nice looking randomized emotics.
